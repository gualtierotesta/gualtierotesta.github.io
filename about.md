I am a software analyst, architect and developer involved in web based applications, mainly Java Enterprise solutions in the Health, Insurance, Government and Banking domains.

Test Driven Development (TDD) and software testing methodologies and techniques are my main interests, without forgetting about coding and code quality.

I work and live close to Milan, Italy.
