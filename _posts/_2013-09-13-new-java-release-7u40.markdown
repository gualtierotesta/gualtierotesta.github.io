Oracle has released new Java 7 CPU (see meaning [here](http://gualtierotesta.wordpress.com/2013/05/30/java-version-numbers/)) release: **7u40**.

Complete release notes can be found [here ](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u40-relnotes-2004172.html)but let me mention two important news.

First is related to several improvements and bug fixes for the Mac OS X platform which include support for Retina displays. For more details, look [here](http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=8000629).

The second one is the inclusion of the JavaFX environment inside the JDK, together with long [list ](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/2col/fx2240-bugfixes-2007741.html)of bug fixes.
