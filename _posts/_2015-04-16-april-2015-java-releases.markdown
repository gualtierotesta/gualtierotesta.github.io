**Java 7**

Java 7 79/80 is the last public release.

As happened for the latest realese, also latest Java 7 update is splitted in two releases:



	
  * Update 79 which includes critical security updates only

	
  * Update 80 which includes 79 updates plus a new command line option to detect deprecated mechanisms: endorsed-standards and extensions.


[Endorsed-standards](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/standards/index.html) is a way to update Java core to the latest version of non Java standards. [Extensions](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/extensions/index.html) allows us to extend the Java core with new libraries and functionalities. Both mechanism have been declared deprecated and they will be phase-out in the next future. The option introduced in Java 7u80 detect if these mechanisms have been used i our environments.
