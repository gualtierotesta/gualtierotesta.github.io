[![The Zen Programmer](/assets/nocover/111x148.png)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18988962)
      [The Zen Programmer](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18988962) by [Christian Grobmeier](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7438731)  

      My rating: [3 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/784477205)
        
  

      Not easy reading, at least for a Western country reader, but very interesting.
Author explains many Zen and Buddhism concepts which are quite distant from my personal (European) experience.
Sometimes topics seems a bit too far from the main book target which it should be, as far as I understood, how to apply Zen approach to programmers daily working life.
Any way there is a lot of intellectual material which I've found very interesting.
Suggested to all programmers who wants to improve his stressed working life.
