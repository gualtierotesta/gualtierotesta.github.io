      [Instant Mock Testing with PowerMock](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18942646) by [Deep Shah](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7378869)  

      My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/790050114)
        
  

      PowerMock is a mocking library which extends EasyMocks and Mockito traditional mocking libraries that cannot access to all code, like static and private methods.
The book has a pragmatic approach while describing PowerMock features, with a rich set of examples.
All examples are based on jUnit and Mockito but PowerMock also supports TestNG and  EasyMocks.
First part of the book describes the installation steps with Maven, Idea and Eclipse.
The rest of the book is dedicated to static methods, final classes, final methods, constructors and private methods mocking.
Examples are valid and well explained.
Suggested to everybody involved in testing, especially on legacy code testing.
