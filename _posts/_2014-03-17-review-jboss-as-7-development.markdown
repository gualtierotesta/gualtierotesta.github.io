[Jboss as 7 Development](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19058592) by [Francesco Marchioni](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3390352)
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/872653924)

Good introduction and overview of Java EE 6 development using JBoss as application server.

Some chapters are dedicated to the installation, management, clustering and
security configuration of a JBoss application server.

The rest of the book (the greater part) is dedicated to Java EE6 development
topics: EJB, CDI, JMS, Soap and RESTful web-services.

There is also a chapter on unit and integration testing (with Arquillian).

The book is well written and with good explanations, even if some topics are only mentioned.

Suggested to everybody interested in starting to work with Java EE6 and JBoss AS 7.
