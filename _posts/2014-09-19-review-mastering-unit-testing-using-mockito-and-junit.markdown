      [Mastering Unit Testing Using Mockito and Junit](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22808856) by [Sujoy Acharya](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7438929)  

      My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1046602944)
        
  

      Good reading. A complete picture on unit testing across applications layers and frameworks.

The author covers all topics related to unit testing Java based applications using jUnit at several application layers (data, business, web), starting from project setup (using Eclipse, ant, maven, gradle and even jenkins) and ending to tests creation best practices.

Even test beginners can benefit for this book because all explanations are clear and complete.

First four chapters explore unit testing concepts by means of jUnit and Mockito libraries.

Chapter five is dedicated to code coverage using both Eclipse plugins and command line tools (via ant, maven and gradle)

There is also a chapter (#6) dedicated to static code analysys with FindBus, PMD and SonrQube.

Remaining chapters are on web (#7) and data (#8) layers testing, on legacy code testing issues (#9) and, finally, on test best practices (#10).
