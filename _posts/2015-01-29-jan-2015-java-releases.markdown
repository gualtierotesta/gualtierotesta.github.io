**Java 9**


New Java version is under development. Preliminary JDK versions and information can be found at [https://jdk9.java.net/](https://jdk9.java.net/)




**Java 8**


Java 8 is the **current** Java version.




Java 8 JDK/JRE update 31 has been released. In addition to several fixes, this release disables by default the SSLv3 protocol which has been found to have a design defect which cannot be solved. If you're curios about it, have a look [here](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/SSLv3+POODLE+Vulnerability+Official+Release/18827).
