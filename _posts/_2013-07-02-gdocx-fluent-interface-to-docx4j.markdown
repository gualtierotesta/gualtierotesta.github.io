[Docx4J ](http://www.docx4java.org/trac/docx4j)is a Java library to create and modify Microsoft Open XML (Word docx, Powerpoint pptx, and Excel xlsx) files.

It is a very complete and stable solution to work on docx files. The API matches the XML structure closely and so it is sometimes difficult to use.

I created a fluent like interface to Docx4j time ago which I have recently open sourced under the **GDocx** name. GDocx let to use Docx4j in a much simpler way.

Project home is at [https://java.net/projects/gdocx](https://java.net/projects/gdocx) where you can download the library, read some documentation and also comment, if you like, on the dedicated forum.
