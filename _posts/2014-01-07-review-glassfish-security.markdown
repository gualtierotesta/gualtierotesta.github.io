      [Glassfish Security](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12481503) by [Masoud Kalali](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5165566)  

      My rating: [2 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/803758551)
        
  

      Well-written but not very detailed and useful.
On some topics, the author does not enter in the detail of the function or the command he is describing.
For example, GlassFish server security description is at same (too high) level of details as the Oracle GlassFish Security Guide.
It would be nice to have real world examples with some suggestions and tips, for example in the auditing/monitoring data analysis.
Operating system security is limited to Ubuntu/Debian systems.
More interesting, but still not very detailed, are the chapters on how to add authentication and authorizations inside JavaEE applications and on OpenDS and OpenSSO integrations.
