Mockito is back with a new release (1.10.x), after almost two years from the last official release (the well-known and loved 1.9.5).

Several 1.10 updates have come out after the 1.10.0 released at the end of this September.

Mockito 1.10.x includes several improvements and cleanups. Interesting is the possibility to create light-weight mocks and the BDD "then" support .

Release notes [here](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/master/doc/release-notes/official.md).

Thanks to Szczepan Faber and the rest of the team for their wonderful job.
