**  JDK 8**

After the 8u11 release on mid of July, Oracle has released JDK **8u20 **which includes several new and updated tools and a significant amount of bug fixes.

Java Mission Control has been updated to version 5.4. JMC is a tool to monitor and collect data from running applications and Java run-time environments.

AMC (Advanced Management Console) is a Java applications and versions usage collector and analysis tool. It requires a commercial license.

Another commercial product is the new JRE installer for Windows which fully support MSI technology.

Nice feature for 64bit users is in the Java Control Panel where we can select to automatically update  both 32bit and 64bit JRE.
