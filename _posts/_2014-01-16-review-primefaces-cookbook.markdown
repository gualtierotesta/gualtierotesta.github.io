[PrimeFaces Cookbook](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17296036) by [Oleg Varaksin](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6909960)
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/784475874)

Suggested reading for everybody involved in web development using JSF 2.

The book collects tens of recipes to solve real world problems using PrimeFaces library. Version 3.4 of this library is used in the examples but the recipes are also valid for the latest 4.0 (so I did in my current project).

First chapter is a quick start to PrimeFaces: how to install it, which are the library dependencies, how PrimeFaces and JSF work, the link to Ajax and the internationalization configuration.

Second chapter is dedicated to the theming and how to customize PrimeFaces components styles using CSS.

Remaining chapters group PrimeFaces components into specific topics : inputs, menu, tables, charts... Everything is needed for a modern user interface.

Last chapter show how to integrate PrimeFaces with JavaScript.
